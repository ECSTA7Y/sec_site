One day, [Zhuangzi](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/) is washing his feet. When he put his feet on the water, he was burned. Zhuangzi felt shocked and drop his hands to water to try the temperature. He felt it is just warm water. He cried: "Ay! Even my senses are so erratic and inexplicable. It seems that our feelings are cheating to us! If our feelings are deceptive, what is the meaning of our life's pain? What we called pain and suffering, maybe just like feet burned by hot water. As hands see, feet's pain just like happiness in warm water. Also, Happiness is like dreaming, with no meaning at all."

Next day, Zhuangzi and his friend, Huizi, are hanging out at a bridge of a river, called Haoshui. Zhuangzi said:"Fish are swimming happily, that is fish's happiness." Huizi said: "You are not fish, thus you could not know fish's happiness." "You are not me, how could you know I don't know fish's happiness?" "I'm not you so do not know you. You're not fish so do know them. The two things are certain"

Ironically, 2200 years after, those two conversations are treated seriously. A professor called [David Lewis](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/) said he fully understand thought of Zhuangzi and wrote a strange paper named *Mad Pain and Martian Pain*[^1].

# 庄子与大卫·刘易斯

一天，[庄子](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhuangzi/)在洗脚，他将脚搁到洗脚水中，居然被烫到了。庄子一惊，把手放到水里试了试，感觉这不过是温水啊。可是自己的脚感觉到的是滚烫的热水。庄子一声哀叹：“唉！连自己的感官都那么飘忽不定、莫名其妙, 可见感觉是会骗人的啊！如果自己的感觉都是不真实的，那么人世间的痛苦还有什么意义呢？所谓的痛苦，也许不过是脚沾到热水那样的幻象罢了。在手看来，脚的痛苦不过就是温水中的怡然自得。快乐亦如是，如梦幻泡影，没有任何意义。”

第二天，庄子和惠子在濠水的一座桥上溜达，庄子说：“鲦鱼在水里悠然自得，这是鱼的快乐啊。”惠子说：“你不是鱼，怎么知道鱼的快乐呢？ “你不是我，怎么知道我不知道鱼的快乐呢？” “我不是你，本来就不知道你；你本来就不是鱼，你不知道鱼儿的快乐，都是肯定的。” 

令庄子哭笑不得的是，2200多年后，自己的信口胡说竟然被当真了。一个名叫[大卫·刘易斯](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/)的教授声称自己领悟了庄子的思想，他得意洋洋地写了一篇名为《疯子的疼和火星人的疼》的奇怪论文，以论证的方式重构了庄子的人生哲学。
